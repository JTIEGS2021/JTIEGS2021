Hello,

My name is Jacob Tiegs. I am Bioinformatics graduate student at Marquette University and currently hold a Informatics Analyst position at MCW. 
I am involved in several projects at the moment, some focused on medical informatics and some focused in Cancer Bioinformatics. 
My interests include genetics and biostatistics.
